## Quick Start

### 1. Generate Logo Concepts

Use the prompts in `prompts/ai-generation-prompts.md` with your preferred AI tool:

**Recommended tools:**
- **ChatGPT/DALL-E 3** - Best for understanding complex requirements
- **Midjourney** - Best for artistic/stylized results
- **Ideogram** - Best for text integration

### 2. Choose a Direction

Four concept directions are provided:
- **Option A**: Geometric "Verse Symbol" (branching paths theme)
- **Option B**: "Metaverse Gateway" (portal/dimensions theme)
- **Option C**: Epic Heritage "V" (brand lineage)
- **Option D**: Tim Sweeney Tribute (portrait silhouette)

### 3. Review Specifications

See `specs/cover-specifications.md` for:
- Exact dimensions (7" × 10" trim, ~1.2" spine)
- Foil stamping requirements (1mm min line width)
- Leather and color recommendations
- Safety margins and bleed

### 4. Refine in Vector Software

Once you have a concept:
1. Recreate/trace in Adobe Illustrator or similar
2. Ensure all lines are minimum 1mm thick
3. Export as solid black on white for embossing die
4. Create separate files for each foil color
